    <h1>🎨 UI/UX Design: The Art of Making People Feel Smart</h1>
    <p class="date">Published: 29 December 2025</p>

    <p>Let’s be honest — we’ve all rage-quit a website because the buttons were playing hide-and-seek. That frustration is exactly what pulled me into the world of UI/UX design. I didn’t want to just build websites. I wanted to build <em>experiences</em> that make people feel like geniuses.
    </p>
  
    <p>So I took Alison’s <strong>“Introduction to UI/UX Design”</strong> course. And wow — it was like putting on X-ray glasses for digital behavior. Suddenly, I wasn’t just coding layouts. I was decoding human logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Here’s what changed:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> I stopped designing for screens and started designing for minds.</li>
      <li>I learned how to guide users like a GPS — no confusion, no dead ends.</li>
      <li>I started spotting friction in interfaces like a mechanic hears engine knocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, every site I touch gets a UX tune-up. Whether it’s a portfolio, a blog, or a client dashboard, I ask:</p> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>Does this feel obvious? Does this feel good?</p>
    </blockquote>  
    <p>Because when users feel smart, they trust you. And trust builds reputation.
    </p>

    <p>This certification didn’t just teach me design. It taught me <strong>influence</strong>. And that’s a skill I’ll use forever.</p>
